        <p> To My Friend,</p>
        <p> Happy Birthday Amina. May Allah grant you many more inshallah ameen. 
            May this year be your best one yet, full of exciting opportunities and wonderful moments.
            I pray that Allah blesses you with lots of happiness and accepts all your duahs.
            I hope you have a good day filled with laughter, love, and joyful surprises that make your heart full.
            Shukran for the amazing friendship, for always supporting me (I really appreciate it), for the laughs, for listening, and for just being you.
            Enjoy your special day to the fullest.
